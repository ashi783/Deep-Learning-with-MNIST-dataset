# Deep-Learning-with-MNIST-dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
# key parameters used in the model:
-learning_rate = 0.7
-batch_size = 100 (How many times all the data to be shown)
-training_epochs = 100
-number of layers in the Nural Network=5
-Optimizer used = GradientDescentOptimizer
# Accurcy achieved in the Model - 98%
